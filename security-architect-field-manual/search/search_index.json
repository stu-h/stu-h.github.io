Discussing and defining the unacceptable outcomes with the senior responsible owner and risk owners for a project is a good way to get them thinking about cyber security and risk management. Unacceptable outcomes should be expressed in clear and plain language so they can be understood by anyone in the team. This concept is taken from the Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) process, which is used to find inadequate controls in a design. A worked example Unacceptable outcomes are best explained through an example. Suppose that you are installing an alarm system in your house and you're defining your unacceptable outcomes for that system. Your unacceptable outcomes may include: Alarm doesn't sound when break in is detected Alarm sounds when break in is not detected Alarm is trigged by pets References Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) Handbook","title":"Define unacceptable outcomes"},{"location":"develop-a-security-culture/define-unacceptable-outcomes/#define-unacceptable-outcomes","text":"When talking to stakeholders, regardless of their proficiency in cyber security risk management or technical literacy it it valuable to understand what is an unacceptable loss or outcome for a system.

They are red lines that must not be crossed. They don't all need to be focused on cyber security, they may be related to project a users' privacy or how a project should be delivered.

Often the best approach to developing the most effective defences is understanding how you go about subverting, side-stepping or otherwise attacking those defences. We've found that this knowledge is best obtained from practical application, either through hands-on training or learning on the job in roles such as a penetration tester. Security Architects should also \"assume compromise\" when designing or reviewing systems. That means even with all the recommended protective security controls implemented (this is highly unlikely with time and budget constraints) you should still expect your system to be compromised. It can be hard to accept that your carefully planned defences will almost certainly be compromised by a suitably motivated attacker. However, breaches do occur, so be ready to detect them and respond quickly. Security Architects can't work in isolation, they have to work as part of a team to make security effective across an entire project, team, or organisation. This means supporting our colleagues, partners and customers, working with other professions towards a shared goal. This often means ensuring that security is an enabler, not a blocker.","title":"Mindset of a Security Architect"},{"location":"the-security-architect/mindset-of-a-security-architect/#mindset-of-a-security-architect","text":"A Security Architect needs to have a \"hacker mindset\" .

This is commonly referred to as a \"T\" shaped person. The general skills and qualities of a Security Architect are described below: Analysis - You can visualise, articulate and solve complex problems and concepts, by interrogating and using data or intelligence to formulate and influence plans. You can interpret complex business and technical issues and identify and recognise a viable solution or control. You can understand and link complex and diverse sets of information to inform the response and approach: for example, identifying vulnerabilities and their impact. Communication skills - You understand security concepts deeply enough to engage with security technologists and communicate in a language that is appropriate to your audience. You can respond to challenge. Design secure systems - You can design secure system architectures through the application of patterns and principles, to meet user needs while managing risks. You can identify security issues in system architectures. Enabling and informing risk-based decisions - You can make and guide effective decisions on risk, explaining clearly how the decision has been reached. You can make decisions proportionate to the level of technical complexity and risk. Research and innovation - You can understand and apply a range of user research methods correctly. You can choose appropriate methods for different phases of a product life cycle and situations. Specific security technology and understanding - You know about system architectures. You can understand the risk impact of vulnerabilities on existing and future designs and systems, and identify how easy or difficult it will be to exploit these vulnerabilities. Understanding security implications of transformation - You can work with business and technology stakeholders to understand the security implications of business change. You can interpret and apply an understanding of policy and process, business architecture, and legal and political implications to assist in the development of technical solutions or controls.

Before we describe what a Security Architect is and the skills and qualities to be good one, we first define Security Architecture itself. A definition of Security Architecture We define security architecture as: The practice of designing computer systems to achieve security goals . For the majority of engagements, these security goals are to: make initial compromise of the system difficult limit the impact of any compromise make disruption of the system difficult make detection of a compromise easy An attacker can attempt to subvert people , process , and technology (often in that order) to undermine security, so security architecture must consider all these aspects of a system. Of course, it is not enough for a system to only be secure. It needs to meet user needs, be cost effective, and account for any other constraints relevant to the scenario. Therefore, we always aim to design a system to be 'just secure enough' whilst balancing these other aspects too.
